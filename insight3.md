## K-NN Nearest Neighbor Algorithim

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithim is a supervised machine learning method that is commonly used in a variety of fields. Before we can get into the implimentation of the fascianting algorithim, it is important to first understand what a supervised machine learning method entails.
