## K-NN Nearest Neighbor Algorithim

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithim is a supervised machine learning method that is commonly used in a variety of fields. Before we can get into the implimentation of the fascianting algorithim, it is important to first understand what a supervised machine learning method entails. With supvervised machine learning, the individual creating the algorithim will input specific data that already contains the correct labels. The algorithim will learn the data that was inputted (with the correct labels), and when inputted with data that is not paired with labels, the algorithim should be able to successfuly label the data based on what it has learned. This method of machine learning is very common for problems that involve the classifiation of pictures or data. However, this method can also reach beyond classification problems, into regression problems. A classification problem often has discrete outcomes –– The image inputted was a wolf OR a pig. On the other hand, regression problems output real numbers that can differ greatly –– determing a weight after being given a height.
