### Creating a Geometric Bar Plot!

This first image is the geometric bar plot alongside a spatial description of Macau using only adm1. The second image is the geometric bar plot alongside the spatial description with adm2. As you can see from the plots below, adm1 only splits Macau up into two muncipalities, while adm2 splits Macau up into 7 parishes. The muncipality known as "Macau" is much more dense than the island below it, Ilhas. The parish known as "Nosa Senhora de Fàtima" (located in the northern most region of Macau) is the most dense parish, and holds 35.162% of the population! Ilhas, the muncipality in the South, only holds 19% of the total population.
