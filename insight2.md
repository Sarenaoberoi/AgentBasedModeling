## Random Forest

#### Decision Trees

Before we begin talking about the number of applications of the Random Forest, it is important to understand the the decision tree. Decision Trees are the basis of the Random Forest, and together, make up a a forest. A decision tree is a common tool used to determine the best option from different consequences. Depending on the specificities of the model, a decision tree can incllude a number of different aspects when choosing an option, including the probability of the certain event occuring, cost effectiveness, and more. One problem that is often observed with the applicaiton of decision trees, is overfitting. Overfittin occurs when the model is able to correctly determine all the *training data* After understanding the decision tree, we can begin to understand the a Random Forest, which is the decision tree but at a higher scale.
