### Gravity Model

After looking into Dr. D's guide to gravity models, and the Garcia et al. paper, I learned a great deal about gravity models and their applications. I have done a lot of research on gravity models in past years, specifially surrounding disease transmission, and know that the models work well to determine the interaction between distinct locations, as well as the movement of individuals from different locations. Dr. D's guide focused on London, and we were able to create a flow map, which showed the how individuals living in London moved from home to their place of work, as well as their main method of transportation. The image below shows the formula used for the gravity model, where Pi is the population of location i, Pj is the population of location j, and Dij is the distance between location i and location j. In his paper, Garcia introduced GTSIM, which is a gravity model that also has layers including socioeconomic, demographic, and envrionmental characteritics. Many of these extra layers are obtained using census and population data. These layers can be very helpful in getting a more comprehnsive understanding of how and why individuals are moving from one location to another. Garcia also touches on push-pull factors, explaining that specific locations often have either push factors, which encourage individuals to leave the locations (high crime rates, poverty), or pull factors that encourage individuals to move to specific locations (high employment rates, closer to transportation networks). These factors have a very large influence on where individuals choose to live and work. Garcia's paper concluded the study by acknowleding that although the GTSIM models were able to capture migration patterns of the different countries realitvely well, they were not able to capture them holistically. In this case, it may be more beenficial to use more than one method instead of just gravity models to better understand migration patterns.

Using the centerpoints identified in project 1, I was able to create a plot of voronoi polygons
