Where  have  we  witnessed  significant  gains  in  our  ability  to  describe,  analyze  and  predict human development processes?   Where do you anticipate hope for using data science as the  means  to  elevate  our  understanding  of  individual  and  community  scale  behavior?  

Where do you identify or anticipate reasons to be concerned about the use of data science in a manner that could serve to harm?   What are some of the major obstacles that exist in order  for  agent-based  modeling  to  contribute  towards reducing  unfreedoms  and  improving upon  the  sum  total  of  freedoms  we  experience  as  humanity?    

What  is  your  prediction  for how agent-based modeling can serve to improve the human condition?

Data science has completely transomed the world we live in today. From convolutional neural networks, to K-Nearest Neighbors, the number of fields that data science can be applied to is infinite. After listening to Owen Barder’s podcast, “Development and Complexity,” I began to further understand the evolutionary aspect of data science. One of the major feats seen in data science, is its ability to adapt and transform as needed. Before I expand more on this topic, I wanted to give a brief description of a complex adaptive system. A complex adaptive system is a system made up of adaptive people, products, firms, and intuitions, that all work together to create a functioning, successful society. This system is continuously changing, and it can be extremely difficult to tailor a specific solution to a problem. With this in mind, it is important to note that with the idea of change and adaptability, data scientists can continue to develop solutions. On the economic side of things, Barder expands on the history of “Nokia.” Beginning as a company that sold rubber boots, Nokia understood the changes in their environment, and began to develop telecommunication devices, which greatly succeeded. However, after the introduction of smart phones, Nokia’s profits rapidly declined as they failed to adapt to their environment and create their own smart phones. This is a common occurrence we see today, as companies are continually trying to improve their products, tailoring them to fit their current environment.            

Through the successes we have seen in data science, the past years have broadened our understanding and research on agent-based modelling. Agent-based modelling is a data science method used for different fields including business models, medicine, and disease transmission. An agent-based model consists of a few different elements that interact with one another: agents, the environment, the relationship between agents, the relationship between agents and the environment, and time. Although people often think that agents can only represent humans, this is a large misconception. Agent based modeling works to model real life situations using agents, the environment, and the interaction between the two. During the large Ebola outbreak in 2014, scientists made use of agent-based models (and gravity models) to get a better understanding of how and where the disease was moving. A gravity model, which works to determine the interaction between two distinct locations, as well as the movement of individuals from different locations, was also a commonly used tool in developing a better understanding of the disease transmission. In the age of the Coronavirus, I believe that agent-based modelling can greatly improve our understanding of the transmission of the disease. Current research has shown the efficacy of this method –– by creating a program that can model different situations including lockdowns, isolations, use of face masks, etc., this program has the ability to help us understand how different situations can affect the outcome of transmission.

Agent Based Modeling has a wide range of applications from understanding disease transmission, to how different companies will interact with each other, and to how individuals get to work everyday. A recent study showed the application of agent based modeling in improving the accuracy of air bags in a car. By using a human (and human behavior) as an agent, and putting the car in different situations (changing of enviornements), the ABM was able to greatly improve the accuracy of the air bags, and let the developer know which parts needed work. As we can see, the accomplishments of agent based modeling and data science are endless.
